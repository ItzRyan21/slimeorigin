# slimeorigin
Adds a slime origin to the Origins Mod.

## This project is archived and will no longer be updated.

I'm sorry to everyone who is waiting for 1.18. There are no plans to update to it, the support on this project has been beyond anything I've ever experienced before, and I'm truly thankful for it. Sadly, I'm very busy with a full-time programming job and university, and I can't give the level of attention this project deserves.

The source code will remain available on my GitHub and will be relicensed under the 'unlicense' essentially meaning I release this project to the public domain, you don't even have to credit me. If you want to make a 1.18 version of slime origin, nothing would make me happier. My GitHub DMs are always open for anyone who needs help understanding my criminally undocumented code.

There is also the matter of the revenue from this page, a moderate amount of money has accrued in the time I have been away from this project. I will be donating it to the Activision Blizzard Strike Fund while it is collecting money, and then to another relevant charity (perhaps Girls who Code) once that strike has no doubt been successful.

Thanks again to everyone who has downloaded this mod, it really means the world to me.
